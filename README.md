# CNN-Tracker-v2
#### The (just slightly) better version of [CNN-Tracker-v1](https://github.com/njoye/CNN-Tracker-v1 "njoye/CNN-Tracker-v1") (which will also most likely be finished)

### Acknowledgement
This project relies on different frameworks, libraries, GitHub Projects and user contributions.

1. [py-MDNet](https://github.com/HyeonseobNam/py-MDNet "HyeonseobNam/py-MDNet")
2. [YOLO (darknet)](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/ "pjreddie/darknet")

Thank you everyone for contributing and for all the work that has been put into other projects that we are able to use!

### Usage
I will extend this part as soon as I've built a first proper system, that works.
If you want to contribute and use this system: so far, this is (not even) a Frankenstein
consisting of YOLO and MDNet. Try to wrap your head around it.

### First results
13/09/17 - Ability to restart tracking with the same network after completely loosing the object (full occlusion), built the emergency mode afterwards. This is probably one of the most important results so far.
