- Added emergency mode (setting threshold lower when score < 0, so that tracking snaps back on after a full occlusion)
- Added some more adaptability to the program
- Added more ideas in comments ...
- Implemented first (untested) darknet usage through shell
- Forgot to say that I added a gitignore for the video file
